Repository dedicated to some simple Haskell Projects created during my Programming Languages Course, short descriptions of each are below. 

* **computeSum.hs**
  >Finds the sum of all natural numbers below 1000. Could be updated to take in a list of numbers if needed
 
 
* **countElements.hs**
  >Returns the length of a list
  
* **doubleZip.hs**
  >Uses the zip method to add up two lists, whie double weighing the first list
  
* **duplicateArray.hs**
  >duplicates entries in an array, i.e [1] -> [1,1]
 
* **functionList.hs**
  >Recursively puts each element of a list through a function
 
* **itemCount.hs**
  >Counts the number of times a specified number appears in a list
  
* **maxValue.hs**
  > Returns the highest value entry in a list
  
* **recursiveP.hs**
  > recursively raises an user specified value to the power of another user specified value
  
* **splitArray.hs**
  > flips the position of the inputs needed for splitAt and performs splitAt.
